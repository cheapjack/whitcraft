## WhitCraft
### A custom pocketmine server for Whitworth Art Gallery, Museum of the Year 2015
Made with [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP), a server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition. It has a Plugin API that enables a developer to extend it and add new features, or change default ones

### Status & Versions

Have a look here to see if our server is compatible with your client. We aim to keep track of updates while maintaining essential plugins and ensuring compatibility. The External server is prioritised but updates can lag depending on availability of development builds. If you love the server and want to minimise downtime don't auto-update!

A new update to `PHP 7` the programming language pocketmine-MP runs on in Oct 2015 may cause some delays to the External server updates but watch this space
