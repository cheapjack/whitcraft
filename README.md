Custom pocketmine server for Whitworth Art Gallery, Museum of the Year 2015

Made with [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP), a server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition. It has a Plugin API that enables a developer to extend it and add new features, or change default ones

### Staying Safe

<img src="https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/blocks/about-us/our-partners/o2/o2-partnership/minecraft-cta-v4.png" width="400">

The NSPCC have this great [online guide](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/keeping-children-safe/online-safety/minecraft-a-parents-guide) for parents and carers and players if you have any concerns about online safety.

The internal WhitCraft server is white-listed while the public one is not, but all server logs are recorded. If you have any concerns please contact Steven Roper at the Whitworth Art Gallery or any staff member.

We cannot accept any liabilty for what may happen on these servers but will endeavour to block any inappropriate behaviour where possible and can ban players where necessary.

### Status, Compatibility & Versions

Have a look below to see if our server is compatible with your client. We aim to keep track of updates while maintaining essential plugins and ensuring compatibility. The External server is prioritised but updates can lag depending on availability of development builds. If you love the server and want to minimise downtime turn off auto-update settings on your client/app!

A new update to `PHP 7` the programming language pocketmine-MP runs on in Oct 2015 may cause some delays to the External server updates but watch this space but latest versions offer cross platform play with Windows 10 minecraft which is currently untested


Server | Server Address | Server Port | Online? | Server Version | iOS Version | Android Version

### What's on the repo

We've included the bare bones of a linux setup on the repo here but have wiped any essential data like passwords and `ops` data. If you want to setup your own version of the gallery you can use the map region files included by cloning the repo and downloading the latest PHP Binaries and `PocketMine-MP.phar` files from the [Jenkins Repo](http://jenkins.pocketmine.net/) and follow the instructions on [PocketMine](http://www.pocketmine.net/) or for more detail on running your own pocketmine server, [Read The Docs](https://pocketmine-mp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

**Happy Crafting!**
