Introduction

Minecraft has in the past 2 years developed a loosely connected community of educators that have begun to explore the potential of the game as a form of social design and learning.

Getting involved in that world and trying to contribute to it is very rewarding and gives you a skill set as an educator that's at once useful and transferable.

These skillsets can then be passed on to participants and other learners easily often in a way they are unaware of. For the past 2 years artist Ross Dalziel hasbeen working with [FACT](http://fact.co.uk/) and the AHRC's (Arts and Humanitites Research Network) [IT as a Utility (ITaaU) Network](http://www.itutility.ac.uk) to explore this area through the [CloudMaker Project](https://github.com/cheapjack/CloudMaker)  

[Whitworth](http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/) Museum of the Year 2015 have worked with Ross to develop a Minecraft Pocket Edition Server as a learning resource to allow people to explore a virtual space inside the real space of the gallery. Today we are going to add to that resource and explore the potential of Pocket Edition and other ways of using Minecraft to learn.

You can find out more and play on the [WhitCraft server here](http://cheapjack.github.io/whitcraft/)
