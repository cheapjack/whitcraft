Activity

 * Represent own drawings from Gallery tours in Minecraft 
 * Prep drawing: Use the graph paper to turn your drawings into pixel art
 * Build these drawings into blocks in PC Minecraft Cluster: images become maps!
  * Find your work area; discuss with nearby players about the scale of their designs
  * Think about scale for your designs: 1 block per graph paper square it 1:1 think how cool it will look at 1:4
