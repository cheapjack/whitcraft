The internal server can be used by prior arrangement with the Whitworth team or can be accessed as described below.\r\n\r\nMade with [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP), a server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition. It has a Plugin API that enables a developer to extend it and add new features, or change default ones\r\nhttps://www.pocketmine.net/ Hats off to the awesome work of @shoghicp\r\n\r\n![whit1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/128456/9811986/43a7816e-5872-11e5-86ca-acfaa4c2cbcb.png)\r\n\r\n### Getting Started on the Public Server\r\n\r\n * Buy the mobile Minecraft app from Mojang from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en) or [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143?mt=8).

We aim to keep track of updates while maintaining essential plugins and ensuring compatibility. The External server is prioritised but updates can lag depending on availability of development builds. If you love the server and want to minimise downtime turn off auto-update!\r\n\r\nA new update to `PHP 7` the programming language pocketmine-MP runs on in Oct 2015 may cause some delays to the External server updates but watch this space but latest versions offer cross platform play with Windows 10 minecraft which is currently untested\r\n\r\n\r\nServer | Server Address | Server Port | Server Version | iOS Version | Android Version\r\n------------ | ------------- |------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------  \r\nInternal (private) | `whitcraft.playat.ch` | 19135 | `1.4.1-980 絶好(Zekkou)ケーキ(Cake) (API 1.11.0)` | `v0.10.4` | `v0.10.5 alpha`\r\nExternal (public) | `whitcraft.uk` | 19132 | `1.5dev-1258 活発(Kappatsu)フグ(Fugu) (API 1.12.0)` | `v0.11.0` | `v0.11.0`\r\n \r\n[![WhitCraft Tour](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wkrTV1UBNUg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkrTV1UBNUg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
